      <h2>Getting to Marquette</h2>
      <p>
        An isolated city deep in the Northwoods, getting to Marquette can be a
        challenge. It's nearly a seven hour drive from Chicago, Detroit, and
        Minneapolis. Flights, especially those from a smaller airport like PDX
        or SBA, typically have multiple transfers. We completely understand if
        the travel is too onerous, whether physically or financially, and you
        choose to celebrate with us in spirit instead.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        That said, Paul has acquired a few tips and tricks that might help you
        get here on a budget. The biggest one though is to <i>BOOK EARLY</i>.
        Flights and hotels only get more expensive the closer you get to the
        wedding.

          <strong>Airports:</strong> The closest airport is
          <i>Sawyer Regional Airport</i> (<strong>MQT</strong>). It's a 25
          minute drive from Marquette. While it's the most accessible, it's not
          always the cheapest.
          <a href="https://marq-tran.com/marquette-sawyer-gwinn-route-schedule/"
            >Bus service</a
          >
          is available from the airport to Marquette.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next closest airport is
          <i>Delta County Airport</i> (<strong>ESC</strong>) in Escanaba. It's
          an 80 minute drive from Marquette and often is cheaper than
          <strong>MQT</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          A little further away is <i>Ford Airport</i> (<strong>IMT</strong>) in
          Iron Mountain, which is 95 minutes from Marquette. If you're flying
          into <strong>IMT</strong> though, keep in mind that it's on Central
          Time, not Eastern Time.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Houghton County Memorial Airport</i> (<strong>CMX</strong>) is 2
          hours from Marquette and rarely has the cheapest flights. But if
          you're planning on extending your trip in the UP by visiting the
          beautiful Keweenaw Peninsula, it could be a good choice.
          <br />
          <br />
          Further away in Wisconsin are
          <i>Appleton International Airport</i> (<strong>ATW</strong>) and
          <i>Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport</i>
          (<strong>GRB</strong>). These two airports are about a 3.5 hour drive
          from Marquette, but they often are much cheaper than other options.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Tip!</i> Use
          <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights">Google Flights</a> and
          plug in multiple airports to see the cheapest available options.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="travel-text">
          <strong>The Portland-Appleton Connection:</strong> For those flying
          from Portland, there is a direct flight to Appleton that runs once
          every Friday and Monday on
          <a
            href="https://www.allegiantair.com/en/flights-from-portland-or-to-appleton-green-bay"
            >Allegiant Airlines</a
          >. These flights are <i>very</i> cheap, and even with the 3.5 hour
          drive to Marquette, factored in, they're often still faster than
          flying to <strong>MQT</strong> with a connection.
          <br />
          Currently, there is a flight leaving <strong>PDX</strong> at 10:30 AM
          on Friday, June 5th. It will arrive in <strong>ATW</strong> at 4 PM.
          The return flight leaves <strong>ATW</strong> Monday, June 8th at 7:30
          AM and arrives in <strong>PDX</strong> at 9:45 AM. Because of the
          early departure of the return flight, it may be optimal to fly into
          <strong>ATW</strong> and fly out of <strong>MQT</strong>/<strong
            >ESC</strong
          >
          for the true budget traveler.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Tip!</i> Coordinate with your other cool Portland friends to split
          a rental car and save BIG MONEY!

        <p class="travel-text">
          <strong>International Travelers:</strong> If you're coming in from
          outside of the United States, you may be able to find signicant
          savings by instead flying into Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada
          (<strong>YAM</strong>). You'll save even more money renting a car on
          the Canadian side, as they charge lower rates because the Canucks
          drive less agressively than Americans. It's a 3 hour drive from there
          to Marquette, winding through the rolling forests of the eastern Upper
          Peninsula. Taking this route will allow you to sightsee the Soo Locks,
          Tahquamenon Falls, and maybe even take a detour to Mackinac Island.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Tip!</i> Make sure to check your passport, visa, and car rental
          policy carefully, as you will be flying into Canada, then driving into
          the United States. You will also need to pay a toll to cross the
          International Bridge.

          Predicting the weather in the Midwest is a fool's errand. It could be
          a heat wave, there could be thunderstorms, or it could be snowing.
          Maybe all three if you're lucky! Most likely, it will be partially
          cloudy and mild. Here's what you can expect from historical trends:

          <br />
          <strong>Historic Average Temperatures for June 6th:</strong> High of
