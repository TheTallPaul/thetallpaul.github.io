      <h2>Getting to Marquette</h2>
      <p>
        An isolated city deep in the Northwoods, getting to Marquette can be a
        challenge. It's nearly a seven hour drive from Chicago, Detroit, and
        Minneapolis. Flights, especially those from a smaller airport like PDX,
        typically have multiple transfers. We completely understand if the
        travel is too onerous, whether physically or financially, and you choose
        to celebrate with us in spirit instead.

        That said, Paul has acquired a few tips and tricks that might help you
        get here on a budget. The biggest one though is to <i>BOOK EARLY</i>.
        Flights and hotels only get more expensive the closer you get to the
        wedding.

          <strong>Airports:</strong> The closest airport is Sawyer Regional
          Airport (MQT). It's a 25 minute drive from Marquette. While it's the
          most accessible, it's not always the cheapest.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next closest airport is Delta County Airport (ESC) in Escanaba.
          It's an 80 minute drive from Marquette. A little further away is Ford
          Airport (IMT) in Iron Mountain, which is 95 minutes from Marquette. If
          you're flying into IMT though, keep in mind that it's on Central Time,
          not Eastern Time.
          <br />
          <br />
          Houghton County Memorial Airport (CMX) is 2 hours from Marquette and
          rarely has the cheapest flights. But if you're planning on extending
          your trip in the UP by visiting the beautiful Keweenaw Peninsula, it
          could be a good choice.
          <br />
          <br />
          Further away in Wisconsin are the airports for Appleton (ATW) and
          Green Bay (GRB). These two airports are about a 3.5 hour drive from
          Marquette, but they often are much cheaper than other options.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Tip!</i> Use
          <a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights">Google Flights</a> and
          plug in multiple airports to see the cheapest available options.

          <strong>The Portland-Appleton Connection:</strong> For those flying
          from Portland, there is a direct flight to Appleton that runs once
          every Thursday and Sunday on
          <a
            href="https://www.allegiantair.com/en/flights-from-portland-or-to-appleton-green-bay"
            >Allegiant Airlines</a
          >. These flights are <i>very</i> cheap, and even with the 3.5 hour
          drive to Marquette, factored in, they're often still faster than
          flying to MQT. As of August 2025, there's no official word if they'll
          be offering this flight in 2026, but if past trends hold, they should
          be releasing their Summer routes before December.
          <br />
          <br />
          <i>Tip!</i> Coordinate with your other cool Portland friends to split
          a rental car and save BIG MONEY!
